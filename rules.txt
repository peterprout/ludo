LUDO RULES
                   
To enter a piece into play from its pool to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. 
If the player has no pieces yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the 
next player. Once a player has one or more pieces in play, he selects a piece and moves 
it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die. Players must 
always move a piece according to the die value rolled. Passes are not allowed; 
if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.

When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a piece already in play, or may 
enter another piece from the pool to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an
additional roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an 
additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player may make one last move 
and then the turn immediately passes to the next player.

If the advance of a piece ends on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent 
piece is returned to its owner's pool, unless the opponent has control of the Genie which
is detailed below. The returned piece can be re-entered into play only when the owner rolls 
a 6. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter 
them.

The Genie starts in the center of the board, not owned by anyone. Every time a player rolls
the dice they have a chance of taking the Genie from the center. Once a player owns the Genie
it can't be taken by another until it has been returned to the center, which also 
has a chance of happening every time the player who owns it rolls the dice. The Genie 
protects all the pieces of the player who controls it. If you control the Genie and a player's
piece lands on yours, instead of your piece being sent back to your pool, theirs is sent back.
Be careful when someone has the Genie!

Have Fun!
